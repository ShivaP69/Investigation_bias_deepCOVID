# Investigation_bias_deepCOVID
TThis project is an implementation of our paper on investigating bias in different previously proposed deep models for COVID-19 detection
We have evaluated multiple well-known deep models
we split data in two different way : subject wise and slice-wise. current studies on the application of DL in health-related data show that slice-wise split overestimates the accuracy of the models and makes them unreliable in clinical diagnostic applications.
